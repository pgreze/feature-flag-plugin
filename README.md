# Feature Switch DSL

Gradle Plugin providing an alternative DSL from BuildConfig
for declaring feature switch without duplicate.

Also a tiny project allowing to see how to write a code generating Gradle Plugin
and plug it with Android Gradle plugin.

## TODO

- rename switch (reserved keyword in Java) to flag and rename fswitch function
- work on compilation avoidance and late generation compared to build config?
- write plugin tests
