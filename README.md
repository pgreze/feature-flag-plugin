# Gradle Feature Flag Plugin

A gradle Plugin allowing to declare feature flag,
alternative to duplicate friendly (but still awesome) Android BuildConfigs.

Also a tiny project allowing to see how to write a code generating Gradle Plugin
and plug it with Android Gradle plugin.

## TODO

- work on compilation avoidance and late generation compared to build config?
- write plugin tests
