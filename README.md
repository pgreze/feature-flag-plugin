# Feature Switch DSL

Gradle Plugin providing an alternative DSL from BuildConfig
for declaring feature switch without duplicate.

Also a tiny project allowing to see how to write a code generating Gradle Plugin
and plug it with Android Gradle plugin.

## TODO

- test with android-library and groovy syntax
- improve DSL avoiding mapOf
- write plugin tests
